As we know the fire sensor will output a HIGH when there is fire and
will output a LOW when there is fire. So we have to keep checking these
sensor if any fire has occurred. If no fire is there we ask the motors to
remain stop by making all the pins high as shown below
if (digitalRead(Left_S) ==1 &&digitalRead(Right_S)==1
&&digitalRead(Forward_S) ==1) //If Fire not detected all sensors are zero
{
//Do not move the robot
digitalWrite(LM1, HIGH);
digitalWrite(LM2, HIGH);
digitalWrite(RM1, HIGH);
digitalWrite(RM2, HIGH);
}
Similarly, if there is any fire we can ask the robot to move in that
PG. 4
direction by rotating the respective motor. Once it reaches the fire the left and
right sensor will not detect the fire as it would be standing straight ahead of
the fire. Now we use the variable named “fire” that would execute the function
to put off the fire. else if (digitalRead(Forward_S) ==0) //If Fire is straight ahead
{
//Move the robot forward
digitalWrite(LM1, HIGH);
digitalWrite(LM2, LOW);
digitalWrite(RM1, HIGH);
digitalWrite(RM2, LOW);
fire = true;
}
Once the variable fire becomes true, the fire extinguishing robot arduino
code will execute the put_off_fire function until the fire is put off. This is done
using the code below. while (fire == true)
{
put_off_fire();
}
Inside the put_off_fire() we just have to stop the robot by making all the
pins high. Then turn on the pump to push water outside the container, while this is done we can also use the servo motor to rotate the container so
that the water is split all over uniformly. This is done using the code below
void put_off_fire()
{
delay (500);
digitalWrite(LM1, HIGH);
digitalWrite(LM2, HIGH);
PG. 5
digitalWrite(RM1, HIGH);
digitalWrite(RM2, HIGH);
digitalWrite(pump, HIGH); delay(500);
for (pos = 50; pos<= 130; pos += 1) {
myservo.write(pos);
delay(10);
}
for (pos = 130; pos>= 50; pos -= 1) {
myservo.write(pos);
delay(10);
}
digitalWrite(pump,LOW);
myservo.write(90);
fire=false;
}
