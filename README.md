# Robotics
An autonomous Arduino-based firefighting robot that detects and extinguishes fires to enhance safety and efficiency.

## Overview
Nowadays, robotics is crucial in our everyday lives. This firefighting robot was designed to help people in any destructive burnt situation where this robot can extinguish burnt area immediately using autonomous system. This autonomous system will be designed using programming in arduino and others additional circuit. With the advancement of technology especially in robotics it is very much possible to replace humans with robots for fighting the fire. This would improve the efficiency of fire fighters and would also prevent them from risking human lives. This project is about building a Fire Fighting Robot Using Arduino which will automatically sense the fire and start the water pump. This advanced firefighting robotic system independently detects and extinguishes fire. In the age of technology, the world is slowly turning towards the automated systems and self-travelling vehicles, fire fighters are at a constant risk of losing their lives. Fire spread rapidly if it is not controlled. In case of gas leakage there can also be an explosion. So, in order to overcome this issue, safeguard life our system comes to rescue. In this study, we developed an Arduino based firefighting robot that has a dual advantage which it can sense the fire and can put it off
before the fire gets bigger and also it can put off the fire before it gets out of control. This robot is designed to have a flame sensor to sense the fire before it becomes out of control and a mini pump will be used to control the water flow. This is built not only for household protection but it can also be used in a store and a company and this robot will be put nearby a flammable material.

## Component Used

### • Chassis
It is a plastic frame of a robot onto which other components are to be attached. 

### • Breadboard
A board onto which circuits are integrated and connections are made through it. 

### • Arduino uno
Arduino uno is the low-cost, flexible, and easy-to-use programmable open-source microcontroller board that can be integrated into a variety of electronic projects. This board can be interfaced with other Arduino boards, Arduino shields, Raspberry Pi boards and can control relays, LEDs, servos, and motors as an output. In this project, we have used Arduino uno to give output to servo motors from receiving input from the flame sensors. 

### • Wheels
Three wheels wherein
• Two wheels are motor driven and attached in front. 
• One wheel is not motor driven which is attached below at the back. 

### • Bo motors
We used 2 Bo motors, which are battery operated motors connected to the wheels in front of the robot and lead the robot to the fire. 

### • L293 motor driver
L293D is a typical motor driver IC which allows DC motor to drive on either directions. L293D is a 16-pin IC which can control a set of two DC motors simultaneously in any direction. 

### • Flame sensors
We used three flame sensors in our robot. A sensor which is most sensitive to a normal light is known as a flame sensor. A flame-sensor is one kind of detector which is mainly designed for detecting as well as responding to the occurrence of a fire or flame. 

### • Servo
Servomotor moves the water cup towards the fire. A servomotor is a rotary actuator or linear actuator that allows for precise control of angular or linear position, velocity and acceleration. 

### • Relay
A relay is an electrically operated switch. It consists of a set of input terminals for a single or multiple control signals, and a set of operating contact terminals. Relay controls high voltage circuits with the help of low voltage signals. 

### • Water pump
Water pump pumps out water from the water cup in order to put off the fire detected by our robot. 

### • Jumper wires
Jumper wires are used to make connections in the circuit.

## Conclusion
• Integrating all the hardware, fire extinguishing tasks are possible to be carried out and executed with minimum level of error. 
• It aids to share out the burden of fire-fighters in fire fighting tasks as the fire-fighters can safely handover the fire fighting tasks to robot. 
• We develop an intelligent multisensory based security system that contains a fire fighting system in our daily life. 
• Total cost of the model: 4800 Rupees.
